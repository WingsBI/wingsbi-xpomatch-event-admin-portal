## What is VAPID?

VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) is a specification that allows web push services to identify your application server. It provides:

1. **Authentication**: Proves your server's identity to push services
2. **Rate Limiting**: Helps push services apply appropriate rate limits
3. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized use of push endpoints

## How It Works in Your Setup

1. **Frontend Registration**: When users allow notifications, their browser creates a push subscription
2. **VAPID Signing**: Your frontend uses the public key to subscribe to push notifications
3. **Server Authentication**: Your notification service uses the private key to send push notifications
4. **Browser Verification**: The browser verifies notifications came from your authenticated server

## Testing Push Notifications

Once configured, you can test push notifications:

1. **Allow Permissions**: Browser will request notification permissions
2. **Register Device**: Frontend automatically registers with your notification service
3. **Send Test**: Use the notification demo to send test notifications
4. **Verify Receipt**: Check if browser shows the notification

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Public Key**: Safe to expose in frontend code
- ‚ùå **Private Key**: Must stay secure on your server
- üîê **HTTPS Required**: Push notifications only work over HTTPS in production

## Integration Status

- ‚úÖ VAPID public key configured
- ‚úÖ Service worker registered
- ‚úÖ Push subscription handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Device registration with notification service
- ‚úÖ Ready for testing

Your notification system is now fully configured with VAPID authentication!
